  Social Dashboard was part of the Frontend Mentors catalog I chose to build in React to practice creating custom components, props, and building on my custom CSS skills.

# Technologies in use / Tech Stack / Built with

  - Vite
  - React
  - CSS

# What I have learned

This was built mainly to solidify React fundamentals. Creating custom components, passing data as props, utilizing conditional rendering, and React hooks like useState. 

# What issues I faced and how I resolved them

Being the first React project I wanted to have live I initially had issues with asset pathing in the build version. After some reading of the Vite documentation, I realized what I was missing and got it up and running!
